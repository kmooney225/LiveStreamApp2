# LiveStreamApp2

## Description

This is a remodel of the realtime livestream app I made in class. I wanted to
expand upon those app ideas and incorporate new features, while implementing the 
MERN stack.

## Objectives

- Gain knowledge of implementing dynamic websites and beautiful props, like SVGs
- Learn more about JavaScript libraries in depth
- Create a full stack project from start to finish
